# PROYECTO 6: API REST
## _thePower - Desarrollo Full Stack_

## Description
This has been my first backend development project, developed to meet the criteria required by the training school, in order to obtain the backend developer degree.

## Project Requirements
- Server with Express
- Connection to a MongoDB Atlas database using Mongoose
- Creation of two models
- A seed that uploads data to one of the collections
- A relationship between collections, an array of related data
- Full CRUD for both collections
- README with project documentation, specifying the endpoints and what each one does
- When updating a collection that has an array of related data, we donâ€™t want this data to be deleted
- We will avoid duplicates in the related array
